# SplittR

This is the React Native front-end for SplittR, a mobile app that allows users to create groups, scan receipts using the Google Vision API and track total group expenditure and how much each member of the group owes. Upon settling up a group, the total that each user has spend is displayed, along with how much they are owed/owe the rest of the group. 

Please see the repository for the back-end, built using Ruby on Rails, [here](https://github.com/caitp222/splittr-backend).

This repository was forked after the group project period ended on October 6 2017.
